Data----grouped into record---------> ecode,ename,salary
similar types of records are grouped into table

	101,AAA,1111,201
	102,BBB,2222,202


tables are grouped into database ( employee,department, manager, account etc)
DBMS-----> sw to manage database

RDBMS----> Relational Database Management System

-Tables
-Procedures
-Functions
-Indexes
-Trigger
-Cursor


Group by clause:
select deptid, sum(salary) as TotalSalary, ------2
MAX(salary) as MaxSalary,
Min(salary) as MinSalary,
Avg(isnull(salary,0)) as AvgSalary,
COUNT(isnull(salary,0)) as TotalNoOfEmps 
from employee
group by deptid---------1
--having avg(salary)>3000-------3
order by avg(isnull(salary,0))-------4


Note : sequence is important in the group by queries




Design table aspects:-

Entities and Relations will decide what are the tables we can have in database.

degree of relation:- number of entities involved in a relation
unary : only one entity is involved in a relation
binary: two entities are involved in a relation
ternary: 3 or above entities are involved in a relation




cardinality ratio:-

1:1
1:m
m:n
m:1


Process of reducting the redundancy in your database is called NORMALIZATION
1NF : there is no repeatition of similar group of data in table
2NF : partial dependency is removed
3NF : transitive dependency is removed   A->B->C  then A->C


=================Contraints=======================
Rules and restrictions on data in database is done by these constraints so that correct data will be present in database at any point of time.
Types of constraints:-
1) PRIMARY KEY:- this is to make the record unique in the table
syntax:-
	create table employe
